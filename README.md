Student Performance Analysis Project:

This project aims to analyse and understand the performance of students based on various factors such as their activities and study time.

Key components considered include: 
-> Ethnicity 
-> Parental Education
-> Extracurricular Activities

These factors are used to determine their impact on student performance. Additionally, the project provides clear visualisations of: 
-> Grade Classes
-> GPA (Grade Point Average)

The analysis is conducted using Python, with data visualisations created using Matplotlib to appropriately present the findings. 
This version maintains all the essential details while improving the flow and readability.
